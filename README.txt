Title: Pokemon War

This is a project created for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Perseverance week 1.

It incorporates HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery.

This is a small play on the card game War using the entire list of Pokemon.
It connects to pokeapi.co to pull stats, sprites, and types of all pokemon, then shuffles them into a deck, and begins the game.

Planned features to be added at a later date:
Pokemon Type Advantage system.
Better layout for desktop play.
Filter for "gimmick" pokemon such as gigantimax or mega-evolutions"

Known Bugs:
If either side runs out of cards during a war, the game declares a winner, however does not actually fulfill the war, nor does it add cards in the pot back into the pool for the next game.
